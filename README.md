## Features

### Dedicated Search Box

Customer feedback indicated that the default search experience in Viva Connections was confusing to end users (e.g. they must wait for a delay before being able to choose to search in SharePoint).

This extension provides a dedicated search box on every page in the Home Site when rendered in Viva Connections. It only appears within Viva Connections - ```it will not show up in the desktop browser!``` ðŸ˜Ž

### Home Button on Every Page

Navigating certain pages in Viva Connections can be tricky... this extension places a **Home Button** on each page so that users can get back to the start quickly and easily. The **Home Button** only appears within Viva Connections - ```it will not show up in the desktop browser!``` ðŸ˜Ž

## Known Issues

* Search suggestions not implemented - ```yet!``` ðŸ˜Ž
* Does not appear on external pages (i.e. pages NOT stored in SharePoint). ðŸ˜ž
